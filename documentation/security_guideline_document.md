# Security Guidelines for ProLabs Riedel Analysis Website

This document outlines the security measures and best practices required to ensure a secure, resilient, and trustworthy implementation of the ProLabs multi-page website (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Clerk Auth + Firebase + Netlify Functions). All developers must adhere to these guidelines from design through deployment.

## 1. Security by Design & General Principles

*   Embed security reviews in every sprint and pull request.
*   Apply **defense in depth**: multiple layers (network, application, data).
*   Follow **least privilege**: grant minimal permissions to services, functions, and users.
*   Configure **secure defaults**: disable debug modes, verbose errors, and unneeded features in production.
*   Adopt **fail securely**: on error, return generic messages and maintain secure state.

## 2. Authentication & Access Control

### 2.1 Clerk Auth Integration

*   Enforce **HTTPS** on all Clerk endpoints.

*   Use Clerk’s JWTs with proper signature verification (avoid `alg: none`).

*   Validate `exp`, `iat`, and `aud` claims on every request.

*   Protect against session fixation by regenerating session tokens on privilege changes.

*   Implement strong password policy via Clerk:

    *   Minimum 12 characters, complexity (upper, lower, number, symbol).
    *   Automatic lockout after repeated failed attempts.

### 2.2 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

*   Define roles: `public`, `authenticated`, `vp_sales`, `vp_product`, `author`.

*   Guard server-side routes using middleware (`middleware.ts`) to check roles.

*   Ensure unauthorized users receive **403 Forbidden**, not data leaks.

*   Restrict access to:

    *   **Services** deep dives & Opportunity Matrix → `vp_sales` or `vp_product`.
    *   **Blog CMS** editor endpoints → `author`.
    *   **Schedule Strategy Session** API → `vp_sales` or `vp_product`.

## 3. Input Validation & Output Encoding

### 3.1 Server-Side Validation

*   Validate and sanitize all user inputs server-side in Netlify Functions and Firebase rules.
*   Use `zod` or `Yup` for schema validation of form data and JSON payloads.
*   Reject requests with unexpected fields or types.

### 3.2 Preventing Injection Attacks

*   Use parameterized queries and Firestore security rules—no string concatenation for queries.
*   Escape or encode dynamic content in React components to prevent XSS.
*   Employ Next.js’s built-in `next/image` and `next/script` SRI for external resources.

### 3.3 Secure File Handling

*   Sanitize image/file names uploaded via the blog CMS.
*   Store uploads in Firebase Storage with restricted read/write rules.
*   Block executable file types; allow only trusted MIME types (e.g., JPEG, PNG).

## 4. Data Protection & Privacy

### 4.1 Transport Encryption

*   Enforce **TLS 1.2+** for all traffic (Netlify auto-configures).
*   Redirect HTTP → HTTPS at the edge (Netlify `_redirects`).

### 4.2 Data at Rest

*   Firebase Firestore and Storage must have encryption at rest enabled (default).
*   Netlify environment variables (Clerk API keys, Firebase credentials) stored securely—no hardcoding.

### 4.3 Secrets Management

*   Define required env vars in `.env.example`, but do **not** commit secrets.
*   Use Netlify’s UI/CLI to inject secrets at deploy time.
*   Rotate secrets periodically and immediately upon suspected compromise.

### 4.4 Logging & Error Handling

*   Mask sensitive data (passwords, tokens) in logs.
*   Use generic error messages in client responses; log detailed stack traces server-side only.
*   Implement rate-limited alerting for repeated auth failures.

## 5. API & Service Security

### 5.1 Netlify Functions (Contact, Scheduling)

*   Validate incoming payloads with JSON schemas.
*   Enforce CORS policy: allow only the production origin (`https://yourdomain.com`).
*   Rate-limit function calls (e.g., `contactForm` endpoint) to prevent abuse.

### 5.2 Firebase Security Rules

*   Write strict Firestore rules:

    *   Allow `read`/`write` only to authenticated users with correct roles.
    *   For blog posts, enforce schema: `title`, `body`, `authorId`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`.

*   Deny writes outside of CMS UI flow—no open write access.

## 6. Web Application Security Hygiene

### 6.1 HTTP Security Headers

Configure in Next.js custom server or `_headers` file:

*   `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload`
*   `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
*   `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
*   `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade`
*   `Content-Security-Policy`: restrict scripts/styles to self and approved CDNs.

### 6.2 CSRF Protection

*   For state-changing POSTs from the client, include anti-CSRF tokens (Clerk provides if using sessions).
*   Validate tokens server-side in Netlify Functions.

### 6.3 Secure Cookies

*   Clerk session cookies: `HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict`.
*   Do not store PII or tokens in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`.

## 7. Infrastructure & Configuration Management

### 7.1 Netlify Configuration

*   Disable debug/logging endpoints in production.
*   Use a minimal build image; remove unneeded plugins.
*   Enforce branch-based deploy contexts with separate env vars for dev, staging, prod.

### 7.2 Next.js Hardening

*   Disable telemetry in `next.config.js`.
*   Sanitize `publicRuntimeConfig` and `serverRuntimeConfig` to expose only needed values.

### 7.3 Firebase Project Separation

*   Use separate Firebase projects for development and production.
*   Assign least-privilege IAM roles to service accounts.

## 8. Dependency Management

*   Maintain `package-lock.json` for deterministic installs.
*   Run `npm audit` and integrate SCA (e.g., GitHub Dependabot) for CVE alerts.
*   Vet all third-party libraries (Clerk SDK, Chart.js, D3.js) for active maintenance and known issues.
*   Upgrade dependencies quarterly, with regression testing.
*   Remove unused dependencies to reduce attack surface.

## 9. CI/CD & Monitoring

*   Configure Netlify deploy previews for every PR.
*   Integrate automated security checks (lint, type-check, vulnerability scans).
*   Enable basic uptime and performance monitoring (e.g., Netlify Analytics).
*   Establish incident response plan: contact list, rollback procedures, and postmortem docs.

**By following these guidelines, the ProLabs Riedel Analysis website will maintain a strong security posture, protect sensitive competitive data, and ensure trusted access for internal stakeholders.**
